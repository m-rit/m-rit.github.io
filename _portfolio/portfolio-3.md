In my role at Coinomad, an early-stage crypto payroll application, I contributed to the backend transition from JavaScript to Golang. This project involves building a platform that facilitates payroll processing in cryptocurrency, providing companies with a seamless way to pay their employees in digital assets. 

## Motivation

 I reached out to one of the owners of Coinomad for potential blockchain-related projects, and they welcomed me to contribute to this application. The motivation to switch to Go was easy support by future members and speedup from current . There are some feature enhancements planned for future where using Go for backend makes more sense.
