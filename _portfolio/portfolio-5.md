In addition to my professional work, I occasionally build small tools and extensions to improve my productivity and experience online. Here are a couple of tools (theyâ€™re not perfect, and I had help from ChatGPT along the way!):

## LinkedIn Drafts Extension
A simple Chrome extension that allows you to add, view, and edit notes associated with a LinkedIn profile. It saves me from juggling external documents to rmeember something about someone

Features: Save, view, and manage LinkedIn drafts easily.
Tech: JavaScript, Chrome Extensions API.

## Hide Thumbnail Blocker
A Chrome extension that removes or hides thumbnails from video platforms to give a cleaner, distraction-free experience. Perfect for those who prefer minimal interfaces without cluttered visuals.

Features: Hide thumbnails across video platforms.
Tech: JavaScript, Chrome Extensions API.
