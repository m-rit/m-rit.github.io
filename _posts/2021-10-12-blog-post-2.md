```go
for _, u := range urls {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        checkUrl(u) // u might have changed by the time this runs!
    }()
}

In Go, the loop variable u is reused in each iteration of the for loop. When a goroutine is created, it doesn't execute immediatelyâ€”it is scheduled to run later. By the time the goroutine runs, the value of u might have changed because the loop might have advanced to the next iteration.
